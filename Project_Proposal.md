## Back story of the project:
The ultimate goal of ministry of health is to end the panadamic as soon as possible. This can be achieved by A Massive Vaccination Effort across the city and country and having a herd immunity by 70% to prevent the disease from spreading.
  
The NYC is a large city and getting to vaccine spots may be hard or the spots are placed in mostly vaccinated areas which can lead can be less beneficial. 
About 40% of New Yorkers uses the subway on daily bases.

This project will make a consultion to the ministry of health to where should the vaccine spots should be placed near to most effective subway station.


 
#### Question/need:
* What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build? 
 > The propose of this analysis is to give insights where the vaccine spots should be placed, in which can contribute to higher overall vaccantion rate in shorter time.

* Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
>This project is benefical to the ministry of health to where should the vaccines spots should placed to the most important subway station that could led to faster herd immunity by analyzing and exploring the data to give insights.

#### Data Description:
* What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
this project based on the following datasets:

>MTA Turnstile data located at http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html.
Public NYChealth Covid-19 vaccineS data and found at https://github.com/nychealth/covid-vaccine-data.

* What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with? 
>In the MTA dataset the sample could be where the most crowded areas/subways and using the second dataset to verify where is the most crowaded areas with least amount vaccinated people.
//* If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

#### Tools:
* How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project? 
The main tools that will be used are:
> - Pandas
> - Matlibplot
> - SQL

* Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
> During the project anaylsis some additional tool may used.
#### MVP Goal:
* What would a [minimum viable product (MVP)](./mvp.md) look like for this project?
