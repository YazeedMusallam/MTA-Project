## Back story of the project:
The ultimate goal of the ministry of health is to end the pandemic as soon as possible. This can be achieved by a massive vaccination effort across the city and country and having herd immunity by 70% to prevent the disease from spreading.
  
NYC is a large city and getting to vaccine spots may be hard or the spots are placed in mostly vaccinated areas which contrubute to end the panadmic slower manner. 
About 40% of New Yorkers use the subway on daily basis and focusing to get the people who is going to work or home is brilliant idea.
Yet, ministry of health is unsure to where the vaccine spots should placed near to specific station.

Ministry of health seeked to SDAIA for recommandation using data science to where should spots be placed.
SDAIA propsed a solution to the ministry of health about where should the vaccine spots should be placed near to most effective subway station.

## Background:
#### Company info:
> Saudi Authority for Data and Artificial Intelligence (SDAIA)

#### Problem statement:
> Ministry of health unsure where to put the vaccine spots as NYC is a huge city, and the question arieses to where the most affactive spots could be with the limited budget.
> The NYC MTA subway are used in about 40% of new yorkers, putting a vaccine spot near everywhere is infeasbile due to overbudget (NYC has about 500 subway stations).
#### Value of the company and recommandations.
> The purpose of this analysis is to give insights into where the vaccine spots should be placed near to the most effictive subway station to cut the costs and people can get vaccinanted on the way to work or home, which can contribute to a higher overall vaccination rate in a shorter time and achieve the herd immunity.
> After doing exploratory data analysis on the data; SDAIA will give a recommendation to where the vaccine spots should be placed .

#### Data Description:
* Datasets with description:
This project based on the following datasets:

> MTA Turnstile data located at http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html.
The NYC MTA Turnstile data has cumulated number of entries and exits for each station in different dates and time. 

> Public NYChealth COVID-19 vaccine data located at https://github.com/nychealth/covid-vaccine-data.
The NYChealth COVID-19 vaccine data provides inforamtion about the vaccine percentage of each NYC district.

#### Scope of the work
Sample size:
> In the MTA dataset, the sample could be where the most crowded areas/subways and using the second dataset to verify where is the most crowded areas with the least amount of vaccinated people.
>  four months (May to August) of both datasets will be used for the analysis.
