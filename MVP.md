### Goal the project:

> The primary goal of the project is to analyze where the most crowded MTA subway stations is with most unvaccinated commuters, this contributes to where should the vaccine spots should be placed to reach goal of 70% herd immunity.

### Interval:
> The interval chosen the most recent four months, the reason behind this is, NYC health started to vaccinate for all ages during the last four months; moreover, four months is computationally feasible.

### Methodology of exploring the data:
> 1) Each subway station was mapped to percentage of fully vaccinated in that region, the analysis was done on only the subway stations areas with less than 65% fully vaccinated, filtering only to the busiest stations.
> 2) Different analysis was implemented to answer the following questions in crowded stations with vaccination percentage less than 65%: <br>
>2.1) Are subway commuters in weekdays different than weekends?  <br>
> 2.2) Is there specific time the subway gets busy?

### Findings:

> The above two figures show stations with number of entries and number of unvaccinated people with area of people fully vaccinated less than 65%.
Also, this conclude the stations in the above figure is the most unsafe subways to commute with.
